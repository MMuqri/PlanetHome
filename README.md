> Your challenge is to overlay Earth science data with human dimensions data from resources like NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators Database, to see if any interesting patterns and stories emerge! --[NASA Space Apps Challenge 2017](https://www.planet.com/docs/api-quickstart-examples/step-2-download/)

This project extends on this concept to analyze the earth satellite and sociological data to come up with new story to tell for social good.
